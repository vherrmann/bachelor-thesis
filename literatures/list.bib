    abstract = {A topological method is given for obtaining lower bounds for the height of algebraic computation trees, and algebraic decision trees. Using this method we are able to generalize, and present in a uniform and easy way, almost all the known nonlinear lower bounds for algebraic computations. Applying the method to decision trees we extend all the apparently known lower bounds for linear decision trees to bounded degree algebraic decision trees, thus answering the open questions raised by Steele and Yao [20]. We also show how this new method can be used to establish lower bounds on the complexity of constructions with ruler and compass in plane Euclidean geometry.},
