    abstract = {A topological method is given for obtaining lower bounds for the height of algebraic computation trees, and algebraic decision trees. Using this method we are able to generalize, and present in a uniform and easy way, almost all the known nonlinear lower bounds for algebraic computations. Applying the method to decision trees we extend all the apparently known lower bounds for linear decision trees to bounded degree algebraic decision trees, thus answering the open questions raised by Steele and Yao [20]. We also show how this new method can be used to establish lower bounds on the complexity of constructions with ruler and compass in plane Euclidean geometry.},

abstract = {The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing (NLP), fueling a paradigm shift in information acquisition. Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.},
