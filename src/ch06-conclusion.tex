\section{Conclusion}

\Rdtlifsnn are a natural extension of \dtlifsnn that allows more compact and efficient approximation of functions. On the other hand it still remains to be seen if they are indeed a better suited model for fitting data and in particular reasoning. Especially our analysis in~\cref{ch:partitions} and~\cref{ch:experiments} might show that they are actually not so much stronger than \dtlifsnn.
